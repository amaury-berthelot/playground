# Playground

This repository is intended to contain personal projects I worked on for fun or to discover new concepts.

## Goals

I will not add everything I do here. This repository will only contain some projects I want to share.

Most of my projects will be kepts on personal repositories and will not be shared.

The history of the project of this repository might be partial. I might use a personal repository as main repository and copy from time to time here.

## Structure

The main branch contains only this README and links to the projects.

To keep a clean commit history by projects, each projects is in a orphan branch of this repository.

The projects branches are prefixed by the project name. For example `the-project-name/main` or `the-project-name/feature/something-cool`.

## Projects

- [discord-bot-blindtest](../../tree/discord-bot-blindtest/main): A Discord bot with a web interface for blindtests.

## Feedback

If you have any feedback, please reach out by opening a discussion in this repository.
